# PHP Url shorting system

This is a PHP Url shorting system which I programmed in 30 to 40 minutes




## Run Locally

To run this you need an Apache2 web server and a MySQL database

Create the database using `mysql.sql` 

Edit in `classes/mysql.php` the variables `$username` and `$password` so it matches you database login
